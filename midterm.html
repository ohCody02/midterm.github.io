        <p>Hello, I am Cody!</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am currently a student at SVSU majoring in Computer Scienece with a minor in Cyber Security. I can code at a intermediate level, there are still many things that I must learn to be more proffecient in my trade. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Using my skills of design and the knowledge that I have learned throughout my classes and through other coding projects. Currently (very slowly) I am working on creating a videogame. It is a project that will take me multiple years and I have been slacking on it lately. I love learning about what is going on in the technological world as well as putting those concepts to use.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I am interested in learning more about coding in general, and one project other than my videogame that I am excited to create is a portfolio. Once I am done with this midterm project I will create a portfolio with my own designs.</p>
